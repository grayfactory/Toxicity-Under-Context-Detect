She’s separated from her parents as a baby for her safety, doesn’t even know them. *Beauty and the Beast* is one that you absolutely need to see, the animated version is one of Disney’s greatest movies, if not the single best. It was the first animated film ever nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, quite deservedly so (but it lost quite fairly to *The Silence of the Lambs* -- nothing had a chance with that kind of competition) and very noticeably contributed to the creation of the Best Animated Picture category. The recent live-action adaptation is watchable by the strength of its source material but it's very bloated, partially because of the completely unnecessary effort to establish Belle as having some kind of engineering skill (when she's already a standout by virtue of being an imaginative bookworm in a provincial village) and establish the villain's shitty little sidekick as gay representation (which was *horrendous*, he's like a walking minstrel show, and his switch to being a good guy in the middle of the third act is plainly forced and nonsensical to the point that the movie *even makes a joke about it*). Belle *definitely* has a father here, in fact his fuckup kicks off the plot — Belle goes out looking for her father after he foolishly takes a wrong turn on the road and wanders into the Beast’s castle, where he is taken prisoner by the Beast (her father’s horse returns without him and then takes Belle back). Belle, against her father’s wishes, offers to be the Beast’s prisoner in her father’s place, and her father returns to town raving about it all hoping to rally help to free her. Everyone assumes her father is crazy, so Belle and the Beast have time for most of the rest of the movie to happen. Persona is extremely and deliberately archetypal, it’s absolutely packed with stuff from Carl Jung. Whoever’s in charge of the SMT stuff over at Atlus is very well-read on psychology, occultism, and most importantly where the two connect to each other. Probably Jordan Peterson too — his vaguely-Christian centrism has a distinct whiff of Hermetic Jungian alchemy to it.\n","gen= Briar Rose/Aurora/Sleeping Beauty disobeys the fairies.

It was the first animated film ever nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, quite deservedly so (but it lost quite fairly to *The Silence of the Lambs* -- nothing had a chance with that kind of competition) and very noticeably contributed to the overall narrative of the movie. The effect was that the Disney fans were more than willing to go along to the effort. You could literally see it actually cheering the end of the world when compared to the begining of man. The Disney fans were all so powerful that they absolutely couldn’t ignore or stop it and made the movie as a whole a world victory. The fans gave the movie a chance, it wasn’t bad, it wasn’t bad by any means, it wasn’t a bad movie, it wasn’t a bad idea, and the movie was a lot better than most of its ilk. Not to mention that the animation was done by the same people that make the movie, who are known for giving their animation a pass, but the people who made the movie were willing to go along to the effort. And it’s kind of the little point of the movie: it’s the little point that the Disney fans are willing to make. They’re very, very capable of not going along to the effort. And the only complaints are that the Disney people don’t care what the world looks like at this point, they love the Disney fans because they’re so powerful.

It's just that, similar to piracy and myriad [other stupid laws](https://www.amazon.com/dp/BZ/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTFbtkr=, you are very unlikely to be prosecuted unless you are already being targeted. The same way you aren't going to get a ticket for not wearing a seat belt unless you are caught doing something else too. However, **and this is the important part**, companies and very public entities don't have the luxury of fading into obscurity the way citizens do, and they already have leverage on them in the form of business licences. If they're big enough they might be able to bribe themselves out of it but they can't exactly afford a public media blitz that they distribute child pornography. That's why you are going to see this stuff being banned on platforms and censored by translation companies, because even if it's likely that the private citizen isn't going to get nabbed for this sort of thing that's not a risk anyone is willing to take with their company and investor's money. *Also you are sorely misrepresenting the ruling in the [Christopher Hadley Case](https://web.archive.org/web/http://www.iasd.uscourts.gov/iasd/opinions.nsf/abb/de$FILE/Handley.pdf). What happened in that case was the court re-affirmed that Hadley could be charged under the PROTECT Act of as long as the material was deemed obscene. That's why he plea bargained after that determination, because he knew full well his material would be deemed obscene and he'd be convicted anyway. Here's a quote from the case that makes it very clear. It's not a separate obscenity charge. It's another provision under the same law which has the same penalty, and you still get put on the sex offender registry as well. >**This conclusion has minimal impact on this case given the almost complete redundancy of the conduct criminalized by subsections (a)( and (b)( with that of subsections (a)( and (b)(. The observable differences between these subsections are ( subsections (a)( and (b)( incorporate the Miller test as essential elements, whereas subsections (a)( and (b)( do not; ( subsections (a)( and (b)( include the “appears to be” language in relation to “a minor;” and ( subsections (a)( and (b)( encompass a broader list of sexually explicit conduct.** > ... > >The indictment in this case simply charges Defendant with violations of subsections (a) and (b). There is no reference to whether Defendant is being charged under subsections (a)( or (a)(, or (b)( or (b)(. The conduct outlined in count one states sufficient facts to allege a violation of § (a)(, and the conduct outlined in counts two through four state sufficient facts to allege violations of § (b)(. Because subsections (a)( and (b)( incorporate the three-prong Miller test for obscenity, these portions of the statute are not overbroad in violation of the Due Process Clause. The conduct alleged in the superseding indictment delineates violations of those constitutional portions of the statute; therefore, Defendant’s argument that the entire superseding indictment must be dismissed based on overbreadth must fail.

See Ashcroft, U.S. at see also Miller, U.S. at Kaplan, U.S. at Thus, regardless of whether § (a)( requires an actual minor, it is nonetheless a valid restriction on obscene speech under Miller, not a restriction on non-obscene pornography of the type permitted by Ferber. **We thus find Whorley’s as applied constitutional challenge to § (a)( to be without merit**.\n","gen= > TL;DR: Stick to, and you won't have any legal issues.

Hypovitaminosis is a thing, so are many microelement defficiencies. If you have suspicions, you can spend hundreds of dollars on blood tests, completely remake your dietary routine or buy $worth of supplements to see if things improve within a couple of weeks. If you suspect you have a vitamin deficiency you should see a doctor because, again, healthy people do not develop vitamin deficiencies. Anyone with a vitamin deficiency in the Western World needs to be checked for various GI absorption or metabolic issues. As someone noted above, iron deficiency in women of child-bearing years being the major exception. On a large scale those of vitamins add up over time and for the vast majority of people they are utterly worthless. The turmeric, ginseng, and various combinations of herbs and spices everyone raves about are an order of magnitude more worthless. The idea that someone can self diagnose hypovitaminosis by seeing if they feel better is really dangerous advice. That sort of subjective interpretation is incredibly prone to attribution errors.

In the middle of these tweets, the account all of a sudden tweeted in support of Donald Trump during the latter’s visit to the United Kingdom, which was met with large protests in London. Besides not containing any personal information, having no profile picture and other Russian troll characteristics, this account only posted tweets in more than a year from its creation in January to February all of them regarding a particular Anime series on YouTube. From April onwards, during the lead-up to the release of The Last Jedi for the home video market, and in anticipation of Solo: A Star Wars Story opening, the account suddenly comes to life and begins tweeting frequently about The Last Jedi, identity politics and Rian Johnson. After the data was collected, the account has been through a “reset” where many of its public tweets have been deleted, leaving only its replies. Gee, I wonder if there's any other demographic besides paid shills for the Russian government who don't care about Twitter enough to bother making a username or uploading a profile picture, value their privacy enough to not upload personal information and to periodically purge tweets, dislike SJWs, like Donald Trump, dislike TLJ, and like anime. >One of the above-mentioned accounts which has now been deleted by Twitter exhibited some of the lingual characteristics that researchers have observed in Russian troll tweets. On July : “So, now explain why Mark Hamil didn't like Luje in TLJ?”. The simplicity and brevity of the language, as well as the fact that this purported Star Wars fan doesn’t spell “Hamill” or “Luke” correctly, are all indicators that raises suspicions. In combination with other characteristics (auto-generated handle, lack of personal matter on account etc.), the verbiage suggests that the user may be a Russian troll. The literature suggests that Russian trolls primarily use mobile apps for Twitter posts, and thus auto-correct and word suggestion on smartphones disguise any poor English skills to an extent.

Yeah, she had hit the cop and obstructing him. So yeah, she should be arrested. No pass on obstructing and resisting just because you've got a vagina and you managed to not be overweight. Yeah, she was making it hard to put the cuffs on. But cops should be trained to determine how much force it will take to get an objective accomplished, and to then not exceed that. Just because you've got the strength to slam a person's head to the sidewalk does not mean that it is the right thing to deploy when there's not any real danger in the situation (unless she starts clawing at the face). This could happen to your grandpa after he had four too many beers and wouldn't leave at closing time. It's not about gender or pussypasses. It is about having law enforcement that isn't trying to escalate just so they get a chance to relive their high school football or wrestling glory.

There are plenty of safe ways to put a person on the ground that don't involve risking damaging their head.

We do not need to use this mentality in our policing. We can use it in the courts. But not on the streets. It DOES take more skill on the part of the cops to subdue someone without hurting them. Similarly, it takes more skill to body-slam someone than to just shoot then in the chest times. We don't tolerate cops shooting people who are not an immediate threat. We require them to use something that admittedly exposes them to more risk and requires more skill on their part.

The different races in Tolkien's world barely tolerate each other, only cooperating when their literal existence is at stake. Elves live in their forests and shun travelers, and eventually altogether leave the world en masse because they find Middle Earth unbearable. Dwarves hole up in their mountains and lock the doors, eventually dying when something more powerful than them shows up to take their stuff. Men are either self-assured that they have no need of the other races, or are too busy trying to make a living to worry about other races. Orcs, trolls, goblins, and the like exist to fulfill their own primal needs of hunger, conquest, and bloodshed; for them, the good races exist only to be slaughtered, enslaved, and eaten. And the Hobbits want nothing to do with any of them. Most D&D settings are going to naturally be more homogenous than Tolkien's Middle Earth. I don't think that's a good or a bad thing, just that it is. But for this self-proclaimed Tolkien enthusiast to pretend like he turned away from D&D simply because of how the races were segregated is absolutely absurd.\n","gen= If this person found D&D so off-putting because of how the races separated themselves from each other, then it doesn't make sense for him to also be a huge fan of Tolkien's work.

Calling it a 'scam' seems pretty unsubstantiated, since the dev team is constantly expanding and improving the product. Clearly money isn't being socked away in someone's offshore bank account. Saying it has taken too long has more merit. But after the unexpectedly wildly successful kickstarter, the project manager asked the backers if they should similarly wildly expand the scope of the project... and most were in favor of it. So all that money went into a much bigger game than was originally pitched. Finally, their methods of raising funds have also been criticized. And for me, this is the seediest part of the game. Offering a land claim token which will eventually allow them to choose land in the universe to gain legal (though imperfect) NPC protection for is silly. On the other hand, the process has been very open and clear to all from the start, so anyone who does contribute funds should know what they are (and aren't) getting. I paid for a game package because I liked what I was seeing, and I'm still pretty happy with it.

I'm not sure what you're asking me. >I don't have to. I don't understand what you're trying to say here. Again, it's hard to get a bearing on what you're saying because you're really not making any points. What makes you believe that Ford would have stepped forwards when she was if the story is true? You seem to agree that we know not all women do who later seem to have valid claims, so not having stepped forward does not necessarily mean the story is made up. It's within the scope of the FBI's powers to give a report to the Senate, because that was the background check. You are telling me to cite (not \"site\" btw) a source that the FBI has the authority to produce a background check that was requested of it for the Senate. >She was fine for his entire career before he was nominated. Yes, dude. Do you not know what a civic duty is? It's an obligation not to yourself, but to your country, a burden of good citizenship like voting or serving on a jury. The transcripts are online, but the relevant sentence of Ford's testimony is, \"I thought it was my civic duty to relay the information I had about Mr. Kavanaugh’s conduct so that those considering his potential nomination would know about the assault.\" You could have consulted a dictionary or listened to Ford's testimony. >This happened to both of them. Again, the civic duty thing changed the balance. I think (hope) that we agree that these kinds of allegations should not be made lightly and should not be taken lightly. The consequences of both airing out a false allegation and of suppressing a real one are severe. It's inherently a balancing act, so, yes, both of their lives are now set before the court of public opinion. Kavanaugh, however, is a public figure, so he put himself out there by nature of his occupation choices, but that's a minor point. I think the bigger point is just that *this is the nature of our adversarial system of law.* The point I was trying to make about the embarrassment and publicness of these allegations, investigations, and prosecutions is not that they shouldn't happen (although we should be cautious, and they've kind of gotten out of hand recently), but that they are an understandable deterrent. I'm not making an argument for whether or not it should change. That's a whole other conversation. I'm making the argument that in light of this, it is understandable why a real victim might not step forwards *until the added conviction that it is her civic duty* tipped the balance in favor of stepping forwards even so many years afterwards. You're missing the point about the supplemental FBI investigation. It was excessively limited in scope and a weak defense for the argument that Kavanaugh never did any of the things alleged. Avenati's trashy (he was Stormy Daniels' attorney, for reference), but that was a side-comment/personal opinion and no excuse for the FBI not even interviewing him or his client. Do you really believe that the supplemental investigation was sufficient? What makes you believe that? I don't think you follow the news, dude. I heard the thing on NPR, but you can Google it, or just do the math on the source I did cite you to immediately afterwards yourself. I'm in law school, so I'm also busy. I didn't listen to all of the testimonies live, but I did stream it afterwards. You're getting defensive because you haven't kept up with this issue as well as you could have. No, I don't know if they listened to the whole thing, but it gives you a ball park of how much of the country was tuned in *when you weren't*.\n","gen= It's hard to reply to you when you're just counter-pointing (and counter-pointing is so easy, dude, come on), not offering any real substance, and definitely haven't read any of the sources I've cited to you.

Yes, the character does not REALLY want to sully his hands due to the conflicting feelings he has, but he didn't really have to do the work himself, and the show goes out of its way to demonstrate that he WOULDN'T do it himself.

A hate crime is a crime against someone for what it is and not being a white supremacist, a “hater,” a person who “doesn’t have a fuckin f**ing hate agenda,” or the like, someone who “is an asshole,” a “man of sense, or a racist,” or whatever. The very definition that the left wants us to think we have any right to have depends on this. If the left wants us to label someone a “hater” or a “person who doesn’t have a fuckin f celebrations,” then we have a case. If we can find a RS that uses the term “hate crime” effectively, that is a case in evidence. > I don’t blame you for being a nigger loving your mom.

You are projecting your insane worldview onto a CHILDREN'S STORY. I'm not sure what aspect of my world view you are calling insane. As far as projecting our world views into stories to interpret them, we all do that. Certainly if we try to imagine the prince with thoughts and personality instead of a THING, it does bring up complex questions which do not occur to us when merely processing him as a plot device when initially watching this as a child. >Whatever trauma you had in your life ... it is YOUR trauma for YOU to deal with. Insisting that the rest of us adhere to your neurotic worldview is both delusional and hubristic. I'm really not interested in dwelling upon your tendency to personally insult people. I'm simply saying that based upon what we see, there is not visible grounds to say that the prince had consent for what he did. There could have been off-camera occurances (these are implied or possible in films all the time) which could have made it acceptabl. We may not have seen all the interactions that PC/SW had, they might have already kissed / fucked / secretly married, she may have told the Dwarves about the prince, etc. There's no PROOF that this is sexual assault / necrophilia, merely the possibility exists and can't be ruled out by the film alone. Something lik https://www.alibris.com/Walt-Disneys-Snow-White-and-the-Seven-Dwarfs-Junior-Novelization-Walt-Disney-Productions/book/might include information lacking in the film which could clear up questions people have on how to interpret some things, I wouldn't be able to tell without reading it. If we go before Disney to http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/pghtml it went rather differently >It happened, however, that a king's son came into the forest, and went to the dwarfs' house to spend the night. He saw the coffin on the mountain, and the beautiful Snow-white within it, and read what was written upon it in golden letters. Then he said to the dwarfs, \"Let me have the coffin, I will give you whatever you want for it.\" But the dwarfs answered, \"We will not part with it for all the gold in the world.\" Then he said, \"Let me have it as a gift, for I cannot live without seeing Snow-white. I will honour and prize her as my dearest possession.\" As he spoke in this way the good dwarfs took pity upon him, and gave him the coffin. >And now the King's son had it carried away by his servants on their shoulders. And it happened that they stumbled over a tree-stump, and with the shock the poisonous piece of apple which Snow-white had bitten off came out of her throat. And before long she opened her eyes, lifted up the lid of the coffin, sat up, and was once more alive. \"Oh, heavens, where am I?\" she cried. The King's son, full of joy, said, \"You are with me,\" and told her what had happened, and said, \"I love you more than everything in the world; come with me to my father's palace, you shall be my wife.\" >And Snow-white was willing, and went with him, and their wedding was held with great show and splendour. In the original tale, my objections are absent. The dwarves are asked, give permission, nothing about the king's son being armed, she wakes up due to accidental dislodging of the apple instead of a kiss. There could still be some elements of coercion with the dwarves, but they are much more active participants and guardians in this case. The wording of KS (king's son) is rather commanding (\"come with me ... you shall be my wife\") which I'm sure some people would still have a problem with. Snow has a positive reaction (\"was willing\") much as she does in the Disney film, but the issue I think some people have is that one cannot assume the reaction will always be positive to things like kissing/carrying without consent or commanding people to accompany/marry you, even though there are certainly women who enjoy having that done to them.\n","gen= Acceptability is certainly always subjective, but in common morality I think family members would be upset and find it unacceptable for people who didn't know the deceased to come and kiss them, or to be admitted to their wake at all.

I formed my opinion by reading the presentation itself. I disagree with this video's assessment that the presentation isn't as bad as it's made out to be. The premises in the presentation are that censorship by the platform owner [is acceptable](https://imgur.com/QdZAl) provided the rules and effects are clear, is [politically neutral, and focused on tone](https://imgur.com/rkYjJ), They see the platform owners as \"[hospitality organizers](https://imgur.com/WVShVvU)\". I reject these premises. For one, I don't see google/twitter/facebook any more a \"hospitality organizer\" than I see my email provider: they provide a service by which I may communicate with others. The standards I use to communicate with friends are vastly different than those I use for business contacts, and I neither expect nor desire those standards to be enforced by the email provider. Secondly, these providers [already see themselves as politically neutral](http://archive.is/ExxVO) and focused on tone, so following those guidelines just gives us more of the same. And of course tone itself isn't politically neutral: see the censoring of the legal term [\"illegal aliens\"](http://archive.is/XeC) (though to their credit they appear to have backed off on that decision). Or the infamous \"gender pronouns\" debate. If I call a M transgender person \"he\", is that \"tone\" (and subject to censorship), \"political\" (and not subject to censorship), or a giant grey area subject to the whims of the censor and how they feel about me and/or the subject on any given day? Thirdly, being transparent about why you'e censoring someone doesn't really help the person being censored that much. We know exactly why The Daily Stormer was deplatformed: the GoDaddy CEO woke up one day and said \"I hate these guys and want them off my site\". When Alex Jones was deplatformed there were news articles and official statements on standby to tell us why it happened. When has such transparency ever answered more questions than it raised? You're still trying to polish the turd that is highly subjective standards with the shine of \"policy\" and \"procedure\". Fourthly, what if I don't want these platforms to \"police tone\"? So far they have a shit track record in policing their platforms; why should I trust them in the future? Earlier the presentation poses the question \"by what right do you do this?\". They try to answer it by saying \"well we'll only focus on tone\", but the question remains: \"by what right are you the arbiter of 'tone'?\" Fifthly, if there is a problem with \"tone\", why enforce a top-down, one size fits all approach to it? Why not empower the users with more advanced tools to filter things themselves (or for others with their consent) without removing the \"offensive\" material from the platform. Filter lists and moderated feeds could be services provided by users, for users and under the total control (including the ability to modify filter lists, opt-in/out of them, and ultimately disable all filtering/moderation) of the end-user. That way people can tailor their experience to suit their own sensibilities rather than having one standard thrust onto everyone. Finally, I love the use of \"family friendly\" terms. When Germany censors things it's to [\"make online spaces safer\"](https://imgur.com/Aju), but when \"dictatorial leaders\" want to do so it's to [\"improve their methods of control\"](https://imgur.com/VHMwhT. And on the [page](https://imgur.com/sejtdVp) where they discuss flagging porn (which has regulations around providing access to children) and malware (which has quantifiable harmful effects) they provide a case study of The Daily Stormer (who was engaged in legal if unpopular speech) being taken off the internet, thereby trying to create a (strained) association between the three.\n","gen= I have no comment on any of the articles written about the presentation, because I didn't read them.

I wish so fucking bad that I had never met this succubus and her constant manipulations and beating phrases into my head still has my brain hooked. It sucks. And what a crock of shit it is that the 'standard' is for people in relationships to just THROW this word \"love\" around like even single percent of women even have the capacity to love the man they are with without constantly looking for trade-up possibilities and encounters they can cop the fuck out of. How uninvested they can be when they tell you GARBAGE like 'were a good *family*' or 'I love you' or 'I choose you' or '(referring to animals) you make a good dad'. Sooo fucked. Where Im from that word \"Love\" actually meant something. My parents were from that magical time when there was actually incentive and a social standard to find someone loyal and be with them. Not be a cheating whore and dip the fuck out of any responsibility for your actions like many modern women. How fucking sick is it that someone would tell you they care about you using a power word, and at the same time be literally ZERO PERCENT invested in your relationship, or even at the very least not emotionally cheating on you or physically cheating on you. TF is the 'right' answer to a woman telling you they love you, if you are average in any way? \"Sureeeeeee you do.\" And why would a woman NOT use the strongest, most manipulating words possible; especially when seeing the power they have on men. They see that shit everywhere. Society beats it into their heads like a fucking drum. Makes me remember those retarded as fuck 'I love you more' battles I would have with my exes. Funny how both girls I used to do that with turned into cheating whores. \"I love you more\" my DICK. Try to find beauty in different places. Its helped me a lot.

For example watch a movie you will like regardless if you are with company. - Think how much you would spend alone, if the date goes well you can increase the amount but only if she agrees to be the one paying the second time. - Kisses and sex early, if she wants to wait for whatever reason its ok, dont push it. The best way to not push it is to stop dating. - Make sure she knows you dont want an stable relationship in a natural way. she will bring the subject 'casually' so just answer equally 'casually'. - Spend at least the same time and money on fun as you spend improving yourself, fun includes fun alone and dating.

In short, I can’t “believe the victim” because I have tweets written by people I’ve talked to without even talking to them. Second, I can’t “believe the victim” because I have tweets written by people I’ve given to a person. I’ve tweeted them out and they responded. They weren’t suspicious or hostile, they were simply enjoying the moment. They agreed with me in a few places in the world watched, and I can’t believe they even actually did it—even though I’ve heard many people tell of others doing it. Third, I can’t “believe the victim” because I have never been around anything more positive than a “public platform” where people make their decision “ automatic” when they see fit. I’m sure many of you knew I was there, but not me. I have never been around a “ public platform” where I try to “ ” “ happen” or “ live” or “ allegro,” which seems to me a very good thing that happened just like it had me.

I’ve seen two videos where a woman went off on a construction worker for not wearing a revealing woman in a meeting. She was literally fucking her in the room. The moment the woman was not against women, she came out and asked for her help. She was telling the truth she was the one that did that to her. That’s why I don’t see women like that on the list. The moment the woman came out, the woman feels ashamed and immediately punches her in the face. She is totally not a threat to women on the list. The woman does not come out in the space of a week. I had seen that before and I will say this again: I think it was a mistake to assume that women like this when they do it. The problem is that I do not think this is a feminist option now. The reason why men like this is because women feel more feminine when they do it. The more men on the list, the more women on the list, the more women on the list. It makes no difference what I think about the list. I think it’s better on it’s own. I think it makes more sense. The only thing that will hold true for women on the list, especially after the confirmation day, is confirmation. The more confirmation, the more women on the list, the more acceptance by women of who they are, especially in America, the fact that they are still more than just a thing, that they are a part of the larger world around them. The world around us means that we have more control over it. The more you can do about this, the more you can do about them. Because of the #TransgenderBathurning and the reasons why women prefer to burn in hell (because they do, the more confirmation they can get, the more they can live off of.

I'd give them a pass on Mimics like Edge Master and Charade, maybe even Rock… but Hwang, Lizardman, Cassandra and Yun not available day for free is just not acceptable. Even with all these included they'd have more than enough cut chars for multiple DLC seasons… before they have to touch the dreaded SCV chars. The games always had alt outfits… this one does not… fucking why?

No Hit Box visualization either. The game also doesn't seem to have a proper command training mode, or Combo Challenges (SCV had something with “Main Moves” and example Combos… ) The training mode is passable but inferior to something like VF or even DoA!!!) > The mechanics are awesome as ever. Probably needs a nerf to RE tho. Yeah… I've heard that for SCV as well \"The Combos do Dmg again”, “JG raises the skill ceiling”, \"no negative GBs\"… didn't save the game from being a broken mess in the end… with a balancing patch that made it even worse. I didn't mention mechanics since I only played the game for like during the Beta and watched streams for a couple of hours. I personally think all additions and changes are detrimental, but only time will tell. RE is just terrible, the omni guard feature is obnoxious and the fucking QTE minigame is one of the worst ideas I've ever seen in a Fighter. The meter omni GI from SCV was dumb, the meterless version from VI isn't any better though. Advantage seems to depend on Dmg of the GIed attack (and not timing as suggested before release), which I also find stupid, but no one knew for sure… maybe if the game had a better training mode… PGI being gone and with it the ability to GI UBs is a bit of plus, that you can't GI GBs at all… is just lame… TE changes are crap as well… if they switch to directional breaks, they should have gone all the way to VFS's system, but that would take effort. Lethal Stuns are just another worthless addition… another slowdown as if there weren't enough already and some of the trigger conditions are just fucking retarded. It's obviously better now with a training mode, but during the beta it was just “why did that just happen?” Overall another regression from the game it reboots… > But ye, not enough fucking hats I personally don't care about CAS and think it's a waste of budget and disk space… but if you just port the unaltered ear old assets into your new game, there is just no fucking excuse to only port half of them. The only reason they are doing this is so they can resell old assets as DLC it already started and the armor packs will most likely be primarily old stuff. As a SC game VI is either stagnation or regression for the series, as a fighting game it simply lacks features you'd expect from a release… that starts with current gen models and ends with in-game frame data.
