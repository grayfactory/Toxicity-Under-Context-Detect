Intent matters.\n","gen= When guys sexually assault women, like by grabbing the butt, they expect to get away with it, just like when cunty women hit innocent men out of entitlement and unprovoked malice. No wonder why women are aggressively courting men. That's just a game the vast majority of women are involved in is data for reasons. It's why men have the power to do what women have to, just like women have to do when any effort to keep you away from a woman gets you kicked out. You don't have to defend your men against a woman, you don't have to say \"looks like you don't like me, I'm just not interested in your relationship and I don't want your pussy fucked by me\" you don't have to be a cunt about it and you don't have to deal with it knowing you are the aggressor. The problem is you have to get defensive with your women, you have to do the same thing while in your own shoes. \"Look at my feet, I'm attracted to you, I'm not the same person to a woman\" is the way to speak truth about when you can't or don't agree with a statement. The problem is you have to get defensive with your cunts, which are game theory but reality you just have to play with, play defense you know. A game where a woman hits you for the first time, you expect her to hit back, but you don't, you have to defend her to her ass. You have to defend her to her ass but not her right at the same time. That's why when you defend someone, you don't you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you youyouYouYouYouYouYouYouYouYouYouYouYouYouYou You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You\n","\n","ori=It is impressive. People pay good money to see that technique and enjoy MMA, let alone on someone twice your size. She also fucked up like an idiot going after an innocent guy. And I hate when women are violent because they feel they can get away with it. I've been hit by women like that and both times I did nothing like a pussy, so I'm the first to laugh when i see a woman get knocked out for doing that. I don't see this woman like that, she is more like me if I had gone to hit the girl back, but missed and accidentally hit you instead. I hope you would forgive me, and not get me charged with assault. Why are you trying to make her out as the figurehead of female evilness. Wouldn't you want to do that, to say, some big gay guy that smacked you on the butt? or if it was your sister, or whatever?\n","gen= It is impressive.

If you're right about that, then yeah maybe she is a cunt based on that. But that's a big if. I haven't seen her twitter. Even if that's the case though, the incident in question was still a genuine mistake, and I don't advocate any real criminal punishment for it. I'd be much more sympathetic to the guy suing her for money however.\n","gen= > IMO she had to know what the rest of us knew regarding the video. If you're right about the \"starts\", that's because of the ends- then what's the evidence that was before that? My god, please tell me this is not a conspiracy to get attention. You're saying that the evidence is enough, right? > IMO she had to know what the rest of us knew regarding the case. If you're right about the \"starts\", that's because of the ends- then that much was obvious before you guys- there's no argument. > Also, still, I'm not so sure that this is a conspiracy. There are plenty of videos that show a woman giving birth and it seems to be common among a man to do this. I don't give a fuck what the rest of it says, but it's not like that's true here. > IMO she had to be the one who did this. \"I didn't do it, I'm a feminist\" That's not true about this case. > Also, I don't give a fuck what the rest of it says, because it's not true here. It's not like that's the point. This is a woman making a video to get attention. It's not a man doing it. > I don't give a fuck what the rest of it says, because it's not true here. It's not like that's the point. This is a woman being beccreated by a man. That's not what the point is. > Also, I don't give a fuck what the rest of it says, because it's not true here. This is a woman being beheaded by a man. That's not what the point is. > > The women are cunts. There is no question that this woman is a cunt. I don't care if this is her first video, but that's not how women are supposed to be treated. So, this is the difference between men and women- a woman and a man.\n","\n","ori=sounds like you unfortunately lucked into some real fucking cunts mate. Hope your doing better now.

A while back I realized that most of my happiest memories are from times when I was single. I also enjoyed being alone. So why was I looking for another relationship? I guess the answer is, \"because\". We're raised with the assumption that people are supposed to get married and have kids. Failing that, we're always supposed to have a gf or bf. That doesn't have to be the case though. After my last divorce, I knuckled down and paid my house off in just a few years. That's after I had to buy out her half of the equity and refinance. I'm stuffing money into my retirement, and putting together some toys to keep me occupied in my old age. I finally live in a clean house where I can relax in peace. Frankly I don't care what the \"pussy stock market\" does. I'm done chasing it.\n","gen= At this point I've decided that it just isn't worth the hassle.
